# Graph Algorithms in C++ (CPP_EX1_25)

This project implements a basic undirected graph structure in C++, along with classical graph algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra**, **Prim**, and **Kruskal** ‚Äî all built **without using the C++ Standard Library (STL)**.

## ‚ú® Features

- Adjacency list representation using custom linked structures.
- Memory-managed Edge and Pointer implementations.
- Custom data structures:
  - `Queue` (FIFO)
  - `PriorityQueue` (min-heap)
  - `UnionFind` (Disjoint Set Union)
- Core algorithms:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path
  - **Prim's Algorithm** for MST
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm** for MST

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

The project uses a `Makefile` for compilation.
